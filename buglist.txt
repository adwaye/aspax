Need to review the following to see if they were solved
(ii)  unite the save method in Menuwidget under one method for neatness
(iii) show the shape of the saved outline in the save message box   : extend the message box class for this: perhaps use the window class in DiagnosticWidgets
(iv)  add the name of the annotations in the diagnostic window when displaying all annotations
(v)   pressing clear when the rotate handle move too far away from the rectItem causes the program to crash
(vi)  make it easier to look up the version number when using aspax


new bugs:
(i) (a)   when creating an xray,one cannot enter a text entry for the date other the image will not load. this relates to INspecteXrays.load_selected_xrays: changed the line that was causing trouble, will check again.
      the xray-id needs to be the default study id:, the xray id appearing in combobox_xrayid is actually the file name: need to think about acceptable formats for the dates and catch when it is being checked for ints
      cannot add an xray to a study if no study are present: so need to get an error if this happens
    (c)  add option to view a dicom as well: create a dicom metadata viewer?
(ii) link the sliders to the handle size on the rectangle as well






Fixed
-create a class that plots the bone outlines into a window, and display this window when pressing on some button on the menu_widget so people know what they have annotated:
      this can now be done by clicking on 'view' in the area_menu_widget
-for the wrist bone annotation need to have a rotate function on the rectangle: this can be done now,
  fix:this was fixed by changing the way the RectItem is being painted, it now uses the x,y coords along with the width and height to generate points which gets turned into a polygon
-check that the control points for both the rectitem and the polyline ites generate coordinates corresponding to the area of interest: this was done on polylines and rectitems
-when loading the score for an xray, if that xray has a saved scoresheet, then it should be displayed.
      fix: need to extend score_menu_widget.create_table_view to also look for the savelocation to search for the score.csv----fixed 21/09/2021 in 0.0.4
-selecting n/a and then clicking on save does not save the annotation---------fixed 21/09/2021 in 0.0.4
-need to be able to track the bones that have been annotated so we can come back to them, especially have the ability to come back to that---implemented 22/09/2021
-message box saying that the annotation was saved-----done 21/09/2021 in 0.0.4
-we want to be able to annotate landmarks----fixed 22/09/2021 in 0.0.4
-hitting cancel or close on the select new folder window does not close it, user has to do this multiple times------> change the implementation to work in a two level mehod, one for opening the dialog
 to fix it, I moved the initialisaton of the filedialog in the xray_selection_menu class and linked this to the buttons there. Also added some invisible qlineedits to contain the name of the files and folders that were selected
 then linked the method in InspectXrays responsible for creating new studies to and item changed signal with these qlineedits. not sure if this is good programing practice----fixed 08/02/2022 in 0.0.8
-when adding xray to a study, the studyid needs to be set already in the dialog by reading the text in the StudyId_combobox ----fixed 08/02/2022 in 0.0.8
