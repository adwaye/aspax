(i)   when loading the score for an xray, if that xray has a saved scoresheet, then it should be displayed.
      fix: need to extend score_menu_widget.create_table_view to also look for the savelocation to search for the score.csv
(ii)  hitting cancel or close on the select new folder window does not close it, user has to do this multiple times
(iii) selecting n/a and then clicking on save does not save the annotation
(iv)  unite the save method in Menuwidget under one method for neatness
(v)   show the shape of the saved outline in the save message box   : extend the message box class for this


new features

-for the wrist bone annotation need to have a rotate function on the rectangle
-need to be able to track the bones that have been annotated so we can come back to them, especially have the ability to come back to that
