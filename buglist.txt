(i)   hitting cancel or close on the select new folder window does not close it, user has to do this multiple times
(ii)  unite the save method in Menuwidget under one method for neatness
(iii) show the shape of the saved outline in the save message box   : extend the message box class for this
(iv)  create a class that plots the bone outlines into a window, and display this window when pressing on some button on the menu_widget so people know what they have annotated
(v)   we want to be able to annotate landmarks
(vi)  for the wrist bone annotation need to have a rotate function on the rectangle


Fixed
-when loading the score for an xray, if that xray has a saved scoresheet, then it should be displayed.
      fix: need to extend score_menu_widget.create_table_view to also look for the savelocation to search for the score.csv----fixed 21/09/2021 in 0.0.4
-selecting n/a and then clicking on save does not save the annotation---------fixed 21/09/2021 in 0.0.4
